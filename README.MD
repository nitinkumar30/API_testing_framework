# API Testing framework

üöÄ Welcome to API Testing framework ! This project demonstrates API testing using Python `requests` library against a sample API server.

## Description

‚ÑπÔ∏è This project showcases how to perform API testing using various HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) with Python and `requests` library. Each method demonstrates different aspects of interacting with an API endpoint, handling request parameters, and processing responses.

## Getting Started

üîß To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/nitinkumar30/API_testing_framework.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the scripts:**
Each script (`get_example.py`, `post_example.py`, `put_example.py`, `patch_example.py`, `delete_example.py`) demonstrates a different HTTP method. Execute them to see the API interactions in action.

## Features

üìã List of features and functionalities of the project:

- **GET Method:** Retrieve data from the server.
- **POST Method:** Submit data to the server.
- **PUT Method:** Update or create a resource.
